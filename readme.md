Hello, and welcome to my Go Reservation repository! This project represents my journey of transitioning from 5 years of experience in Laravel to exploring Golang with the aim of making it my primary programming language.

## About Me

I am a dedicated web developer with a strong background in PHP and Laravel. Over the past five years, I have honed my skills in building web applications, working with databases, and delivering high-quality software solutions.

## Why Golang?

While I have extensive experience in PHP, I've always considered Golang as an exciting and promising technology. Its performance, concurrency capabilities, and clean syntax have intrigued me for a long time. Now, I am enthusiastic about transitioning to Golang full-time to explore its potential and contribute to the growing Go community.

## This Repository

This repository represents a basic application created from scratch as part of my Golang learning journey. Through this project, I aim to:

- Gain a deep understanding of Golang's core concepts and best practices.
- Explore how to build efficient and reliable applications using Golang.
- Collaborate with the open-source community to learn and grow as a developer.

- Using [go](https://go.dev/) 1.20

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to my mentor [Trevor Sawler](https://www.udemy.com/user/trevor-sawler/) and the Udemy course that inspired me to embark on this journey. While this repository is a work in progress, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions, suggestions, or opportunities for collaboration.
